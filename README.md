### About me
Hobby-coder since 1982. Started with BASIC on a ZX81, now predominantly using Python 3 on Raspberry Pi and macOS. In real life I'm a chemical engineer with a wide range of experience in extrusion & gravure coating, photographic emulsion making (O/W & silver halide), power plant monitoring and emissions monitoring (using OSIsoft PIMS), fine chemicals manufacturing, process batch control (acc. ISA-88; using CENTUM CS3000 & Foxboro DCS), manufacturing execution (acc. ISA-95), the list goes on...  
Currently, my focus is on process automation and batch control acc. ISA-88 and manufacturing execution system applications (MES acc. ISA-95).
